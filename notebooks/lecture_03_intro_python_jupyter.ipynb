    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, also referred to as a *high-level language*, or as a scripting language.  What this means is that when you write some commands, or statements that are meaningful in the Python language, the Python 'interpreter' reads the command, figures out what the intended computation is, and then executes it.  This differs from *low-level* languages like C or C++, in which you generally have to *compile* code  before you can run it, and if you find errors they have to be diagnosed and then the code re-compiled before you can run it.  Interpreted languages skip the compile step, and just execute code directly, and if there are errors, they are seen at run-time.  "

The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser, called a Jupyter Notebook.

    "- **conditional execution**: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.\n",
    "- **repetition**: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n",

In Python, the type is inferred at run time, and you can always ask Python what the type of an object is:"
